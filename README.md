A chrome extension built during ShellHakcs that transforms Netflix profiles into a social hub.
Each user profile can leave custom ratings and personal thoughts on a show or movie, and other profiles within their family plan would be able to see them.

## Feautres 
- Pulls Netflix user profiles (including profile photos)
- Custom ratings (from 1 to 5 stars) and reviews for shows and movies
- Prototype comment overlay (demo: tested with *How I Met Your Mother*)
- Stores ratings/reviews for cross-profile visibility

## How It Works
1. When browsing Netflix, the extension identifies the active user profile.
2. Allows the profile to submit a rating and their thoughts on a piece of media.
3. Displays saved reviews across the platform.

## Current Limitations 
- Comment feature still in progress
- Overlay is functional but only for demo (same comment pops up for all titles)
- Ratings may save and may not save, its wishy washy.
